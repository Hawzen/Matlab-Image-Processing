# Matlab-Image-Processing  <br/>
HW1: Display a grey scale image of your choice (hint: use `imshow`) <br/>
HW2: Generate a 256x256 random array then display it as an image (hint: use `rand`, `imshow`) <br/>
HW3: Transform image generated in HW2 to text (hint: use `char`) <br/>
HW4: Generate 8 images -bit planes- of image (hint: read and apply code in pg.30 in book) <br/>
HW5: Arithmetic operations on an image. <br/>
HW6: Histogram equalization. <br/>
HW7: Display image with lookup table. <br/>
HW8: Use and apply filter. Average filtering. <br/>
HW9: Laplacian filter. <br/>
HW10: make mat2grey. <br/>
HW11: Edge sharpening. <br/>
HW12: Non linear filter. <br/>
HW13: Median filter. <br/>
HW14: Low pass filter and high pass filter. <br/>
HW15: Create speckle noise. Clean it with Median filtering. <br/>
HW16: Apply function written in figure 5.6 but experiment with different D values <br/>
HW17: Apply average filtering. <br/>
