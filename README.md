# Matlab-Image-Processing
HW1: Display a grey scale image of your choice (hint: use `imshow`)
HW2: Generate a 256x256 random array then display it as an image (hint: use `rand`, `imshow`)
HW3: Transform image generated in HW2 to text (hint: use `char`)
HW4: Generate 8 images -bit planes- of image (hint: read and apply code in pg.30 in book)
HW5: Arithmetic operations on an image.
HW6: Histogram equalization.
HW7: Display image with lookup table.
HW8: Use and apply filter. Average filtering.
HW9: Laplacian filter.
HW10: make mat2grey.
HW11: Edge sharpening.
HW12: Non linear filter.
HW13: Median filter.
HW14: Low pass filter and high pass filter.
HW15: Create speckle noise. Clean it with Median filtering.
HW16: Apply function written in figure 5.6 but experiment with different D values
HW17: Apply average filtering.
